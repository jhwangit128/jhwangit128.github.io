# DRINK RECIPE DATABASE

This app allows users to search for Drink & Cocktail recipes from around the world and save any recipe they wish.
It also has a drink tracker which users can keep track of how many number of days they've been drinking and if they have been drinking too much, there is a warning alert box pops up. I included an image carousel for the users to look through images of randomly picked drinks.

# APPROACH TAKEN

I wanted to add something that I've learned from this program as much as possible. (From FOR LOOP to Ajax)

# UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

I want to develop this app so that user can have more option to choose from in the drink tracker section. Instead of number of days, users can add daily drink consumption (how many cups or bottles).
I did a user testing with my roommate at the end and I realized that instead of using image carousel with buttons, it would be much easier for the users to just swipe them.
