# DRINK RECIPE DATABASE

This app allows users to search for Drink & Cocktail recipes from around the world and save any recipe they wish.

This app also has a tracking ability which users can keep track of how many number of days they've been drinking.  

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
JQuery
AJAX

# APPROACH TAKEN

I wanted to add something that I've learned during this program as much as possible. From FOR LOOP to Ajax.

I added an image carousel for users to look through the images of random drinks.

# UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

I want to develop this app so that user can have more option to choose from in the drink tracker section. Instead of number of days, users can add daily drink consumption (how many cups or bottles).
